=================
This is a simple pipelined processor that implements a subset of the MIPS instruction set. For a more detailed, perhaps longwinded, description see the manual.pdf in the paper directory. This document also lists the supported instruction set. 

##The basics:
This is a three stage pipelined CPU. It is modeled in *pretty much* System Verilog. The CPU is modeled after this design drawing.
